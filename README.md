Before I started my writing on the clone of this website, I want to thank Masai School for giving me the opportunity and for providing this great platform to enhance my coding and soft skills.

More Details...
---------------
It was a challenging journey for me and all of my team members. we have to complete the project within one week. So we faced lots of challenges like it was our first project and we didn’t have any experience working in a team. We didn’t have any idea i.e. how to manage everything within a time period.

Hence, we started with planning and studying the website, then we distributed the workflow and the roles, and with great collaboration with responsibilities, we managed the work.

Live Deployment :
--------------
We have deployed this project on the netlify website.
